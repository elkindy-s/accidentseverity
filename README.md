Accident Serverity Model
The provided Python code creates a linear regression model to analyze road accident severity. It uses a hypothetical dataset with independent variables such as road type, weather conditions, speed limit, time of day, and the presence of traffic signals to predict accident severity, which is the dependent variable. The model is trained, saved, and can be used to predict accident severity for new data. This code can be useful for understanding and predicting accident severity, which has applications in traffic safety and prevention strategies.
